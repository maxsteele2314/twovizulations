   I chose this graph because it showed the programmers ability to create eye appealing material. It is clearly evident that it took 
   many of hours to create the ranging circles that clearly show the information while aslo being incredibly appealing.

   While this visulization did it's purpose it is as bland as physically possible. It isn't appealing to the eye as it lacks
